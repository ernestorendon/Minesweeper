# Minesweeper

This classic game of logic is easy to learn but can be hard to master!

Every tile is either a mine, has a mine in its neighboring tiles, or has no mines in it or its vicinity; using numbers that tell you how many mines are around you, try to clear all the tiles while avoiding the mines!

## Technical Details:

The game is written entirely in C++, leveraging the Simple and Fast Media Library (SFML). The next stage for this game will be to develop a statically linked version of the game that includes all SFML dependencies for the ability to run the game on most computers (as of now, the game can only run in an instance of CLion)
